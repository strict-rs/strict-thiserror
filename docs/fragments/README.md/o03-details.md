## Details

- Thiserror deliberately does not appear in your public API. You get the same
  thing as if you had written an implementation of `std::error::Error` by hand,
  and switching from handwritten impls to thiserror or vice versa is not a
  breaking change.

- Errors may be enums, structs with named fields, tuple structs, or unit
  structs.

- A `Display` impl is generated for your error if you provide `#[error("...")]`
  messages on the struct or each variant of your enum, as shown above in the
  example.

  The messages support a shorthand for interpolating fields from the error.

    - `#[error("{var}")]`&ensp;⟶&ensp;`write!("{}", self.var)`
    - `#[error("{0}")]`&ensp;⟶&ensp;`write!("{}", self.0)`
    - `#[error("{var:?}")]`&ensp;⟶&ensp;`write!("{:?}", self.var)`
    - `#[error("{0:?}")]`&ensp;⟶&ensp;`write!("{:?}", self.0)`

  These shorthands can be used together with any additional format args, which
  may be arbitrary expressions. For example:

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum Error {
      #[error("invalid rdo_lookahead_frames {0} (expected < {max})", max = i32::MAX)]
      InvalidLookahead(u32),
  }
  ```

  If one of the additional expression arguments needs to refer to a field of the
  struct or enum, then refer to named fields as `.var` and tuple fields as `.0`.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum Error {
      #[error("first letter must be lowercase but was {:?}", first_char(.0))]
      WrongCase(String),
      #[error("invalid index {idx}, expected at least {} and at most {}", .limits.lo, .limits.hi)]
      OutOfBounds { idx: usize, limits: Limits },
  }
  ```

- A `From` impl is generated for each variant that contains a `#[from]`
  attribute.

  The variant using `#[from]` must not contain any other fields beyond the
  source error (and possibly a backtrace &mdash; see below). Usually `#[from]`
  fields are unnamed, but `#[from]` is allowed on a named field too.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum MyError {
      Io(#[from] io::Error),
      Glob(#[from] globset::Error),
  }
  ```

- The Error trait's `source()` method is implemented to return whichever field
  has a `#[source]` attribute or is named `source`, if any. This is for
  identifying the underlying lower level error that caused your error.

  The `#[from]` attribute always implies that the same field is `#[source]`, so
  you don't ever need to specify both attributes.

  Any error type that implements `std::error::Error` or dereferences to `dyn
  std::error::Error` will work as a source.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub struct MyError {
      msg: String,
      #[source]  // optional if field name is `source`
      source: anyhow::Error,
  }
  ```

- The Error trait's `provide()` method is implemented to provide whichever field
  has a type named `Backtrace`, if any, as a `std::backtrace::Backtrace`. Using
  `Backtrace` in errors requires a nightly compiler with Rust version 1.73 or
  newer.

  ```rust
  use std::backtrace::Backtrace;

  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub struct MyError {
      msg: String,
      backtrace: Backtrace,  // automatically detected
  }
  ```

- If a field is both a source (named `source`, or has `#[source]` or `#[from]`
  attribute) *and* is marked `#[backtrace]`, then the Error trait's `provide()`
  method is forwarded to the source's `provide` so that both layers of the error
  share the same backtrace. The `#[backtrace]` attribute requires a nightly
  compiler with Rust version 1.73 or newer.


  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum MyError {
      Io {
          #[backtrace]
          source: io::Error,
      },
  }
  ```

- For variants that use `#[from]` and also contain a `Backtrace` field, a
  backtrace is captured from within the `From` impl.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum MyError {
      Io {
          #[from]
          source: io::Error,
          backtrace: Backtrace,
      },
  }
  ```

- Errors may use `error(transparent)` to forward the source and Display methods
  straight through to an underlying error without adding an additional message.
  This would be appropriate for enums that need an "anything else" variant.

  ```rust
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum MyError {
      ...

      #[error(transparent)]
      Other(#[from] anyhow::Error),  // source and Display delegate to anyhow::Error
  }
  ```

  Another use case is hiding implementation details of an error representation
  behind an opaque error type, so that the representation is able to evolve
  without breaking the crate's public API.

  ```rust
  // PublicError is public, but opaque and easy to keep compatible.
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  #[error(transparent)]
  pub struct PublicError(#[from] ErrorRepr);

  impl PublicError {
      // Accessors for anything we do want to expose publicly.
  }

  // Private and free to change across minor version of the crate.
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  enum ErrorRepr {
      ...
  }
  ```

- See also the [`anyhow`] library for a convenient single error type to use in
  application code.
